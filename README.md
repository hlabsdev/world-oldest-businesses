# Data Manipulation and Joining Data with Pandas

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates data manipulation and joining techniques using the pandas library in Python. It was completed as a part of the DataCamp Associate Data Scientist track, following the "Data Manipulation with Pandas" and "Joining Data with Pandas" courses.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Cleaning**: Prepare raw data for analysis by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- **Data Manipulation**: Perform data transformations such as filtering, aggregating, and reshaping.
- **Data Joining**: Merge multiple datasets to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
- **Insights**: Extract actionable insights and visualize the results.

## Project Details

### 1. Dataset(s)
- [Include a brief description of the dataset(s) used. For example: "The dataset includes sales data from various stores, containing columns such as `store_id`, `date`, `sales_amount`, etc."]

### 2. Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Describe the cleaning process, e.g., handling missing values, removing duplicates.
2. **Data Manipulation**: Detail the transformations applied to the data, such as filtering specific records or aggregating data.
3. **Data Joining**: Explain how datasets were merged or joined. Mention the key columns used for joining.
4. **Analysis & Visualization**: Briefly describe the analysis performed and any visualizations created to communicate findings.

### 3. Files Included
- `data_cleaning.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook detailing the data cleaning process.
- `data_manipulation.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook showing the data manipulation techniques.
- `data_joining.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data joining and integration.
- `visualizations/`: Folder containing charts and plots.
- `README.md`: This file.

### 4. Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:
